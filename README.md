# bssh

bssh is a collection of command-line tools for bulk SSH and SCP operations. Originally written in 2006 on Linux, these scripts still run flawlessly on modern systems (including macOS) with no modifications. This project is a testament to the power of CLI tools and the Unix philosophy.

## Overview

bssh provides a suite of utilities to perform parallel and sequential operations across multiple servers. The primary commands include:
- bssh: Run SSH commands in parallel.
- bsshs: Run SSH commands sequentially.
- bput: Copy files (via scp) in parallel from local to remote hosts.
- bputs: Sequential version of bput.
- bget: Copy files (via scp) in parallel from remote to local hosts.
- bgets: Sequential version of bget.

The scripts use a simple nodes file to specify target hosts and their groups.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/meirm/bssh
```

2. Copy the Scripts to Your PATH (adjust paths as needed):

```
cd bssh
sudo cp bssh bsshs bput bputs bget bgets /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp lib/bcommon.pm /usr/local/lib/  # Or another location in your @INC
```

3. (Optional) Add the repository directory to your PATH instead of copying the scripts.

## Setting Up Your Nodes File

bssh expects a file called nodes in either `~/.bssh/` or `/usr/local/bsshtools/etc/`. To create a default nodes file, run:

```
bssh --init
```

This creates a file with the following content:

```
localhost:all
```

Edit this file to include your servers. For example:

```
localhost:all
192.168.4.100:wawa,all
192.168.4.101:wawa,all
192.168.4.102:all
myserver1:dev,all
myserver2:dev,all
```

## Usage

### Parallel SSH Commands

Run a command on all servers in the all group:

```
bssh @all uname -a
```

### Listing Nodes

See which nodes match your criteria:

```
bssh @all -ls
```

### Using Ranges and Exclusions

Run a command on the first three nodes in your nodes file:

```
bssh :0-2 uname -r
```

Exclude a specific group:

```
bssh @all -@wawa uptime
```

Run a command on a specific host:

```
bssh 192.168.4.101: df -h
```

### Adding SSH Options and Dry Run

Specify custom SSH options:

```
bssh --sshoptions "-i /path/to/key -p 2022" @all uptime
```

Perform a dry run (prints the commands without executing them):

```
bssh --dry-run @all uname -n
```

### File Transfer with bput and bget

bput (parallel file copy to remote hosts):

```
bput @all /etc/motd /tmp/
```

bget (parallel file copy from remote hosts):

```
bget @all /etc/passwd ./backups/
```

### Sequential Versions

If you prefer to run commands sequentially, use:
- bsshs: Sequential SSH commands.
- bputs: Sequential file copy to remote hosts.
- bgets: Sequential file copy from remote hosts.

Their usage is identical to their parallel counterparts.

### Advanced Tips
- Default SSH Options:
Store persistent options in `~/.bssh/sshparams` (e.g., `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`).
- Combining Patterns:
You can mix ranges, groups, and exclusions in a single command:

```
bssh :0-5 @dev -@excluded sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- Error Handling:
In parallel mode, each child process returns an exit code. Sequential scripts handle errors one by one.

## Conclusion

bssh is a powerful toolkit for managing multiple servers with ease. Whether youâ€™re deploying code, transferring files, or gathering logs, these tools help automate repetitive tasks with the simplicity and elegance of Unix command-line philosophy.
